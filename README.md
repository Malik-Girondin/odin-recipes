In this project, I learned to create multiple HTML pages via VS CODE and git.

* I downloaded created the repository on GitHub and then downloaded a local copy of it to my MacBook using git clone.
* I learned to edit the HTML boilerplate to my liking by adding links, images, and data.
* I learned to commit the changes often and to make sure I can revisit them without drawing a blank. Over 23+ detailed commits!
* The homepage of the project 'index.html' has three relative links to three recipes pages: Asian Beef, Beef Stew, and Burrito.
* I learned to use tags like <ol>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>, <img>, and much more! This was an interesting project that I enjoyed!
